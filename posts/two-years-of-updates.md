Wow, time really flies when you're having fun. It's been over two years since my last update, so let's see how some of the things I've talked about in the past have evolved.. er.. intelligently designed?

* [Regarding career politicians in Tennessee]({% post_url 2013-04-21-primary-challengers-wanted %}), two out of three career politicians in Tennessee are still in office.
* [Regarding Mark Sanford]({% post_url 2013-05-10-sc-01-have-you-no-shame %}), turns out SC-01 **_does_** have some shame.. [5 years later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sanford#2018).
* [Regarding the interwebs]({% post_url 2013-05-26-webs-dead-baby-part-1 %}) , it's still dead, despite this very blog post.
* [Regarding the Googles]({% post_url 2014-05-17-why-im-no-longer-a-google-fanboy %}), I waffle on the Google fanboy stuff. I wouldn't say I'm a fanboy of Google, but I still use Gmail and Docs. They're damn convenient.
* [Regarding Bootstrap]({% post_url 2014-12-08-the-purpose-of-twitter-bootstrap %}), if you're using [Angular](https://angular.io), do yourself a favor and use [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) and skip bootstrap.
* [Regarding .NET Core 1.0]({% post_url 2017-01-13-NET-Core-1.0-Not-Ready-for-Primetime %}), .NET Core 2.1 and later are officially ready for primetime and getting better every day.

So what's new? I got divorced and now I am living by myself in a one bedroom apartment in Nashville, TN that costs twice what it did 10 years ago. Progress?
